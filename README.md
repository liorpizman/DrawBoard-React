## Online Draw Board

> Background

A common online drawing board.

A user who enters a page located in a particular address will be able to draw different elements on the page. (Eg square, circle, triangle, and so on).
Another user who enters the same address will be able to view the same painting created by the previous user, and can add their own elements to the drawing.

You can enter the page at any time and see all the elements created by the different users of the page.
